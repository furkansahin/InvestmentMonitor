# InvestmentMonitor
This is just a personal investment monitor implemented with Python.

to use run script as follows;
```
python currency.py <Currency names used as from> to <currency names used as to> done <invesment amounts>
```

For example
```
python currency.py USD EUR to TRY done 1000 1000
```

since for now I just use a free service from currencylayer.com to fetch the live currency rates you must list USD as the first surrency ratio because of limited number of provided services
